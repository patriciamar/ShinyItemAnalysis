- Changes in ShinyItemAnalysis 1.1.3 (2017-05-25) -
---------------------------------------------------

MAJOR UPDATES

  o ShinyItemAnalysis can now handle missing values.
  o Bug in WrightMap was fixed.
  o Pearson's correlation coefficient between factor scores and
    standardized total score was added for Bock's nominal IRT model.
  o New options for reports were added. Be default no IRT models and
    no graphs of correlation structure are fitted.
  o Option of item purification was added into some DIF detection
    methods - Delta plot method, Mantel-Haneszel, Logistic regression
    with total score, Lord's test and Raju's test.
  o Default option of p-values adjustments in DIF detection methods
    was set to 'none'.
  o We have new contributor - Lubomir Stepanek!
  o New online mirror was added.
  o Busy indicator and tooltips were added.
  o IRT models are now fitted only by mirt package.
  o Training plots of characteristic curves were added into IRT models
    section.
  o Structure of application was mildy updated.

MINOR UPDATES

  o CITATION file was added.
  o Maximum upload size was set to 30MB.
  o Item names were fixed and unified.
  o Some typos were fixed.
