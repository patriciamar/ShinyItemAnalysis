\usage{
ItemAnalysis(data, y = NULL, k = 3, l = 1, u = 3,
maxscore, minscore, cutscore, add.bin = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix or data.frame of items to be examined. Rows represent respondents, columns
reperesent items.}

\item{y}{vector of criterion values.}

\item{k}{numeric: number of groups to which may be data.frame x divided by the total score.
Default value is 3.  See \strong{Details}.}

\item{l}{numeric: lower group. Default value is 1. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{u}{numeric: upper group. Default value is 3. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{maxscore}{numeric or vector: maximal score in ordinal items. If missing, vector of obtained maximal scores is imputed. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{minscore}{numeric or vector: minimal score in ordinal items. If missing, vector of obtained minimal scores is imputed. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{cutscore}{numeric or vector: cut score used for binarization of ordinal data.
If missing, vector of maximal scores is imputed. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{add.bin}{logical: If TRUE, indices are printed also for binarized data. See \strong{Details}.}
}
\value{
\code{ItemAnalysis} function computes various traditional item analysis indices. Output
is a \code{data.frame} with following columns:
  \item{\code{Difficulty}}{average score of the item divided by its range}
  \item{\code{Average score}}{average score of the item}
  \item{\code{SD}}{standard deviation of the item score}
  \item{\code{SD bin}}{standard deviation of the item score for binarized data}
  \item{\code{Correct answers}}{proportion of correct answers}
  \item{\code{Min score}}{minimal score specified in \code{minscore}; if not provided, observed minimal score}
  \item{\code{Max score}}{maximal score specified in \code{maxscore}; if not provided, observed maximal score}
  \item{\code{Obtained min}}{observed minimal score}
  \item{\code{Obtained max}}{observed maximal score}
  \item{\code{Cut score}}{cut-score specified in \code{cutscore}}
  \item{\code{ULI}}{generalized ULI}
  \item{\code{ULI default}}{dscrimination with ULI}
  \item{\code{RIT}}{correlation between item score and overall test score}
  \item{\code{RIR}}{correlation between item score and overall test score}
  \item{\code{Item criterion}}{correlation of item score with criterion}
  \item{\code{Item reliability}}{item reliability index}
  \item{\code{Item reliability woi}}{item reliability index (scored without item)}
  \item{\code{Item validity}}{item validity index}
  \item{\code{Item criterion}}{correlation between item and criterion \code{y}}
  \item{\code{Alpha drop}}{Cronbach's alpha without given item}
With \code{add.bin == TRUE}, indices based on binarized data set are also provided
and marked with \code{bin}.

\description{
\code{ItemAnalysis} function computes various traditional item analysis indices
including difficulty, discrimination and item validity. For ordinal items the difficulty and
discrimination indices take into account minimal item score as well as range.
}
\details{
For ordinal items the difficulty and discrimination indices take into account
minimal item score as well as range.

For calculation of discimination ULI index, it is possible to
specify the number of groups \code{k}, and which two groups \code{l} and \code{u}
are to be compared.

In ordinal items, difficulty is calculated as difference of average score divided by range
(maximal possible score \code{maxscore} minus minimal possible score \code{minscore}).

If \code{add.bin} is set to \code{TRUE}, item analysis of binarized data is
included in the output table. In such a case, \code{cutscore} is used for binarization.
When binarizing the data, values greater or equal to cut-score are set to \code{1},
other values are set to \code{0}.

# loading 100-item medical admission test data sets
