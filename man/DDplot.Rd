\arguments{
\item{Data}{numeric: binary or ordinal data \code{matrix} or
\code{data.frame} which rows represent examinee answers (\code{1} correct,
\code{0} incorrect, or ordinal item scores) and columns correspond to the
items.}

\item{item.names}{character: the names of items. If not specified, the names
of \code{Data} columns are used.}

\item{discrim}{character: type of discrimination index to be calculated.
Possible values are \code{"ULI"} (default), \code{"RIT"}, \code{"RIR"}, and
\code{"none"}. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{k}{numeric: number of groups to which data may be divided by the total
score to estimate discrimination using \code{discrim = "ULI"}. Default
value is 3.  See \strong{Details}.}

\item{l}{numeric: lower group. Default value is 1. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{u}{numeric: upper group. Default value is 3. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{maxscore}{numeric: maximal scores of items. If single number is
provided, the same maximal score is used for all items. If missing, vector
of achieved maximal scores is calculated and used in calculations.}

\item{minscore}{numeric: minimal scores of items. If single number is
provided, the same maximal score is used for all items. If missing, vector
of achieved maximal scores is calculated and used in calculations.}

\item{bin}{logical: should the ordinal data be binarized? Default value is
\code{FALSE}. In case that \code{bin = TRUE}, all values of \code{Data}
equal or greater than \code{cutscore} are marked as \code{1} and all values
lower than \code{cutscore} are marked as \code{0}.}

\item{cutscore}{numeric: cut-score used to binarize \code{Data}. If numeric,
the same cut-score is used for all items. If missing, vector of maximal
scores is used in calculations.}

\item{average.score}{logical: should average score of the item be displayed
instead of difficulty? Default value is \code{FALSE}. See \strong{Details}.}

\item{thr}{numeric: value of discrimination threshold. Default value is 0.2.
With \code{thr = NULL}, no horizontal line is displayed in the plot.}

\item{criterion}{numeric or logical vector: values of criterion. If supplied,
\code{disrim} argument is ignored and item-criterion correlation (validity)
is displayed instead. Default value is \code{"none"}.}

\item{val_type}{character: criterion validity measure. Possible values are
\code{"simple"} (correlation between item score and validity criterion;
default) and \code{"index"} (item validity index calculated as
\code{cor(item, criterion) * sqrt(((N - 1) / N) * var(item))}, where N is
number of respondents, see Allen & Yen, 1979, Ch. 6.4, for details). The
argument is ignored if user does not supply any \code{criterion}.}

\item{data}{deprecated. Use argument \code{Data} instead.}
}
\description{
Plots difficulty and (generalized) discrimination or criterion validity for
items of the multi-item measurement test using the \pkg{ggplot2} package.
Difficulty and discrimination/validity indices are plotted for each item,
items are ordered by their difficulty.
}
\details{
Discrimination is calculated using method specified in \code{discrim}. Default
option \code{"ULI"} calculates difference in ratio of correct answers in upper and
lower third of students. \code{"RIT"} index calculates correlation between item
score and test total score. \code{"RIR"} index calculates correlation between item
score and total score for the rest of the items. With option \code{"none"}, only
difficulty is displayed.

\code{"ULI"} index can be generalized using arguments \code{k}, \code{l} and \code{u}.
Generalized ULI discrimination is then computed as follows: The function
takes data on individuals, computes their total test score and then divides
individuals into \code{k} groups. The lower and upper group are determined by \code{l}
and \code{u} parameters, i.e.  l-th and u-th group where the ordering is defined
by increasing total score.

For ordinal data, difficulty is defined as a relative score:\preformatted{(achieved - minimal)/(maximal - minimal)
}

Minimal score can be specified by
\code{minscore}, maximal score can be specified by \code{maxscore}. Average score of
items can be displayed with argument \code{average.score = TRUE}. Note that for
binary data difficulty estimate is the same as average score of the item.

Note that all correlations are estimated using Pearson correlation
coefficient.
