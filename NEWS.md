### Changes in version 1.4.1 (2022-04-14)

**_THIS IS A CRAN VERSION_**

#### BUG FIXING
  * `gDiscrim()` function was fixed to assure indices are inside the defined 
    bounds, also for small samples
  * `plotDistractorAnalysis()` function was fixed not to display double legends. 
    Thanks to Scarlett Escudero for reporting this issue.
  * Item difficulty/discrimination plot in Tradition item analysis tab in the app 
    was fixed to prevent error messages when Discrimination type is set to "none".
  * Displayed item parameters were fixed and subsequently extended in the app for 
    the Bock model (see major updates).
  * The training sections for GRM IRT model was fixed to display category plots 
    also for case of k = 6.
  
#### MAJOR UPDATES
  * The `ItemAnalysis()` has been refactored substantially; memory demands are 
    lowered multiple times, as well as run times (most noticeable with large datasets). 
    The changes include following:
    - The function now returns `NA`s for "gULI" when `k`, `l`, and `u` arguments 
      are not specified, as there are no sensible defaults. Previous defaults 
      resulted in exactly the same values that ULI already provided on its own.
    - The `Index.rel.drop` is not provided anymore, as it is not well defined 
      (see Gulliksen, 1950, for more details on  reliability index (`Index.rel`)).
    - The `bin` and `add.bin` arguments were removed, the analysis on binarized 
      data can be conducted by simply providing the cutscore in the `cutscore` argument.
    - The `criterion` argument now defaults to `NULL` instead of `"none"`, but 
      behaves the same.
    - Deprecated arguments `data`, `y` are now defunct.
  * The `DistractorAnalysis()` and  `plotDistractorAnalysis()` functions have been 
    improved: argument items allows options `"all"` to apply for all items (default), 
    or a vector of item names (column names of `Data`), or item  identifiers 
    (integers specifying the column number).
  * The `Anxiety` dataset was added.
  * Baseline Logit Slope-Intercept (BLIS) parametrization for Bock nominal 
    response model is now available as a package function. Fitted model supports 
    IRT reparametrization (to so-called BLIRT) using a standard `coef()` method as well.
  * The app training sections for NRM IRT model now includes parameters in 
    parametrizations and identification restrictions assumed by Bock (1972), 
    Thissen et al. (2011), as well as BLIS and BLIRT parametrizations accounting 
    for the correct option.
  * The DIF section in the app was updated to work with the newest difNLR package version.
  
#### MINOR UPDATES
  * `gDiscrim()` newly issues a warning when item(s) range is zero and when there 
    is no difficulty difference in either group.
  * In `gDiscrim()`, the groups are newly defined using the `quantile()` function. 
    In the case of ties, the respondents with the same total score are now in 
    the same group, the groups sizes may thus differ, but are now exactly defined. 
    The function may however provide different numerical results than in the previous 
    version.
  * In `gDiscrim()`, you can now change how the dataset is split by passing 
    arguments to `findInterval()`.
  * RStudio Addin was added to provide command-free app startup option, bindable 
    to a keyboard shortcut.
  * The `HCI` data now includes total score variable.  
----------

#### BUG FIXING
  * Math in downloadable tables is now completely correctly transformed to human-readable
    (non-LaTeX) format everywhere (thanks to Larry Nelson for reporting this issue).
  
#### MAJOR UPDATES
  * The package dependencies that are used only in the interactive app *per se*
    were moved into `Suggests`, meaning you are now not obliged to install any
    of these dependencies if you plan to only use the package's "core" functions, 
    such as `DDplot()` or `ItemAnalysis()`.
  * The `startShinyItemAnalysis()` function now checks for dependencies required 
    for its proper run and offers to install these dependencies if any of them 
    is not available.
  * New dataset `HeightInventory` was added.

#### MINOR UPDATES
  * Manuals of R functions and data were updated

    edited. 
  * In the `DIF/Fairness` section of the app, the logistic and the polytomous 
    regression models now offer both the IRT and the intercept-slope 
    parametrization; the total score is newly offered as the matching criterion 
    besides the standardized total score.
  * In all sections of the shiny app, the wording was edited. 
  * The ggWrightMap() function was rewritten to exclude dependencies other than 
    ggplot2. 
  
  
#### MINOR UPDATES
  * The sample R code snippets were moved to a separate directory.
  * In the `Criterion validity` and `Item criterion validity`, the Pearson 
    correlation is newly used as the default option.

    `Data`, `Regression models` and the `DIF/Fairness` sections of the app, and 
    in the `plotDIFLogistic()` function.
  * Section `Summary` of the app was renamed to `Scores` to beter reflect focus 
    of this section. 
  * In the `Validity` section of the shiny app, the dendrogram is newly enabled 
    even if numclust == 0.

### Changes in version 1.2.1 (2017-07-16)

#### MAJOR UPDATES
  * Several bugs were fixed:
     - Interpretation of regression models was fixed.
     - Interpretation of text about correlation in Predictive validity
       was fixed.
  * `ShinyItemAnalysis` now used also `data.table` package.
  * Data page was divided into two subpages to avoid long rendering
    of tables.
    when changing datasets.
  * Function `gDiscrim()` to calculate generalized discrimination was
    implemented.
  * Function `DDplot()` was edited to be able to handle generalized
    discrimination.
    Double slider was added into `Traditional analysis page`.
  * Traditional analysis table was extended by adding column
    with generalized
    discrimination. This is done also in reports.
  * Some pages has now their own source code files:
     - `Summary` - Summary.R
     - `Validity`- Validity.R
     - `Traditional analysis` - TraditionalAnalysis.R
     - `Regression` - Regression.R
     - `IRT models` - IRT.R
     - `DIF/Fairness` - DIF.IRT

#### MINOR UPDATES
  * Last three rows in regression comparison table are now bold.
  * Reference list was extended.
  * The subpage `Distractors` of `Item analysis` page was mildly edited.
  * Generalized DD plot was removed from `Distractor` subpage. It is now
    available on `Traditional item analysis` subpage.
  * Item patterns frequency plot is now made with `ggplot2` package.
  * Names of downloaded plots were customized and their resolution was
    increased and size of text was descreased in some pages:
     - Summary
     - Validity
     - Item analysis
     - Regression
