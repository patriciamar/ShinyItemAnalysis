#' NIH grant peer review scoring dataset
#'
#' @description The `NIH` dataset (Erosheva et al., 2020a) was sampled from
#'   a full set of 54,740 R01 applications submitted by black and white
#'   principal investigators (PIs) and reviewed by NIH's Center for Scientific
#'   Review (CSR) during council years 2014--2016.
#'
#'   It contains the original random sample of white applicants as generated by
#'   Erosheva et al. (2020b) and a sample of 46 black applicants generated to
#'   obtain the same ratio of white and black applicants as in the original
#'   sample (for details, see Erosheva et al., 2021a). The dataset was used by
#'   Erosheva et al. (2021b) to demonstrate issues of inter-rater reliability in
#'   case of restricted samples.
#'
#'   The available variables include preliminary criterion scores on
#'   Significance, Investigator, Innovation, Approach, Environment and a
#'   preliminary Overall Impact Score. Each of these criteria and the overall
#'   score is scored on an integer scale from 1 (best) to 9 (worst). Besides the
#'   preliminary criteria and Overall Impact Scores, the data include applicant
#'   race, the structural covariates (PI ID, application ID, reviewer ID,
#'   administering institute, IRG, and SRG), the matching variables -- gender,
#'   ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not), career stage, type of academic degree,
#'   institution prestige (as reflected by the NIH funding bin), area of science
#'   (as reflected by the IRG handling the application), application type (new
#'   or renewal) and status (amended or not) -- as well as the final overall
#'   score. In addition, the file includes a study group ID variable that refers
#'   to the Matched and Random subsets used in the original study.
