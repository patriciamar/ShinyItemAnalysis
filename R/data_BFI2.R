#' BFI2 Dataset
#'
#' `BFI2` dataset (Hřebíčková et al., 2020) consists of responses of
#' `r format(nrow(BFI2), big.mark = ",")`
#' respondents
#' (`r format(nrow(BFI2[BFI2$Gender == 0, ]), big.mark = ",")`
#' females,
#' `r format(nrow(BFI2[BFI2$Gender == 1, ]), big.mark = ",")`
#' males) to Big Five Inventory 2 (BFI-2). It contains 60 ordinal items, vector
#' of age, education, and vector of gender membership.
#'
#'
#' The items prefixed with `i` are item scores. Items are indicators of 5 latent
#' personality factors/dimensions/domains, which are further broken down into
#' so-called facets. The 5 personality domains are: N = Negative Emotionality, E
#' = Extraversion, O = Open-Mindedness, C = Consciousness and A = Agreeability.
#' These are further broken down into so-called facets, as shown in the
#' following table:
#'
#' | **Domain** | **Facet** | **Item numbers** |
#' | --- | --- | --- |
#' | E | Sociability (scb)| 1, 16, 31, 46 |
#' | E | Assertiveness (asr)| 6, 21, 36, 51 |
#' | E | Energy Level (enl)| 11, 26, 41, 56 |
#' | A | Compassion (cmp)| 2, 17, 32, 47 |
#' | A | Respectfulness (rsp)| 7, 22, 37, 52 |
#' | A | Trust (trs)| 12, 27, 42, 57 |
#' | C | Organization (org)| 3, 18, 33, 48 |
#' | C | Productiveness (prd)| 8, 23, 38, 53 |
#' | C | Responsibility (rsp) | 13, 28, 43, 58 |
#' | N | Anxiety (anx)| 4, 19, 34, 49 |
#' | N | Depression (dep)| 9, 24, 39, 54 |
#' | N | Emotional Volatility (emt)| 14, 29, 44, 59 |
#' | O | Intellectual Curiosity (int)| 10, 25, 40, 55 |
#' | O | Aesthetic Sensitivity (aes)| 5, 20, 35, 50 |
#' | O | Creative Imagination (crt)| 15, 30, 45, 60 |
#'
#' In the original instrument, some items are inversely oriented, i.e., the
#' higher score means the lower latent trait. This was the case of items number
#' 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 36, 37,
#' 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 55, and 58. These **items have been recoded**
#' for you, i.e., displayed is value of `6 - original score`.
#'
#' In the sample code, alternative item names are provided. These item names
#' can be used to decode the item domain, facet, item number, and
#' whether it was recoded or not. For example, `iCorg03r` stands for recoded 3rd
#' item (out of 60) from Consciousness domain and Organization facet.
